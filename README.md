Feel free to modify this because this is a simple physics test to see if apples drop with gravity. 
tips to make it fun:
- at a various angle you can stack apples and drop them from the dirt block.
- you can change the image files and and make them simply more fun.
- you can change some codes and add simply new animations and make them more fun to play.

Things that can make this better:
- making a start and exit menu.
- making different levels menu.
- making a start and end limit.
- making an interstellar design to make this more like astrophysics.
- making easy, medium, hard, and custom modes to enjoy. 
- promoting this game.
